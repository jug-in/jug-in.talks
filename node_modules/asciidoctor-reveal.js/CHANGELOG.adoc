== 2.0.1 (2019-12-04)

Important Bug Fix::
  * Fixed an issue that caused all `reveal.js` options in CamelCase to use the default value instead of one specified as an AsciiDoc attribute ({uri-issue}263[#263], {uri-issue}267[#267])

Compliance::
  * Dropped support for verse table cells ({uri-issue}246[#246]).
    Asciidoctor 2.0 dropped it, we followed.

== 2.0.0 (2019-02-28)

Upgrade considerations::
  * Node.js API change!
    If you generate your reveal.js presentations using the node/javascript toolchain, you need to change how the {project-name} back-end is registered to Asciidoctor.js.
    Instead of `require('asciidoctor-reveal.js')` you need to do:

    var asciidoctorRevealjs = require('asciidoctor-reveal.js');
    asciidoctorRevealjs.register()
+
This change enables new use cases like embedding a presentation in a React web app.

  * Anchor links generated by {project-name} will change from now on when revealjs_history is set to true (default is false).
    This is the consequence of upstream fixing a long standing issue (see https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/1230[#1230] and https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/2037[#2037]) and us removing a workaround (see {uri-issue}232[#232]).
    Explicit anchors are not affected.
  * Custom CSS might require adjustments.
    Source and listing block are less deeply nested into `div` blocks now.
    See {uri-issue}195[#195] and {uri-issue}223[#223].
  * The reveal.js `marked` and `markdown` plugins are disabled by default now.
    It is unlikely that they could have been used anyway.
    See {uri-issue}204[#204].
  * Dropped the ability to override the Reveal.JS theme and transitions dynamically with the URL query.
    Was not compatible with Reveal.JS 3.x series released 4 years ago.

Enhancements::
  * Easier speaker notes: a `.notes` role that apply to many AsciiDoc blocks (open, sidebar and admonition) ({uri-issue}202[#202])
  * Added a role `right` that would apply a `float: right` to any block where it would be assigned ({uri-issue}197[#197], {uri-issue}213[#213], {uri-issue}215[#215])
  * Allow the background color of slides to be set using CSS ({uri-issue}16[#16], {uri-issue}220[#220], {uri-issue}226[#226], {uri-issue}229[#229])
  * Reveal.js's fragmentInURL option now supported ({uri-issue}206[#206], {uri-issue}214[#214])
  * Documentation improvements ({uri-issue}141[#141], {uri-issue}182[#182], {uri-issue}190[#190], {uri-issue}203[#203], {uri-issue}215[#215], {uri-issue}216[#216], {uri-issue}222[#222])
  * Support for Asciidoctor.js 1.5.6 and build simplification ({uri-issue}189[#189], {uri-issue}217[#217])
  * Support to specify and use reveal.js plugins without modifying {project-name}'s source code ({uri-issue}196[#196], {uri-issue}118[#118], {uri-issue}201[#201], {uri-issue}204[#204])
  * Node / Javascript back-end is now loaded on-demand with the `register()` method.
    This allows embedding {project-name} into React or any other modern Javascript environment.
    ({uri-issue}205[#205], {uri-issue}218[#218], {uri-issue}219[#219])
  * `revealjsdir` attribute is set to a more sensible default when running under Node.js ({uri-issue}191[#191], {uri-issue}228[#228])
  * Node / Javascript back-end updated to use Asciidoctor.js 1.5.9.
    This extension is built with Opal 0.11.99.dev (6703d8d) in order to be compatible.
    ({uri-issue}227[#227], {uri-issue}240[#240])

Compliance::
  * AsciiDoc source callout icons now work ({uri-issue}54[#54], {uri-issue}168[#168], {uri-issue}224[#224])
  * New reveal.js 3.7.0 features supported: `controlsTutorial`, `controlsLayout`, `controlsBackArrows`, new `slideNumber` formats, `showSlideNumber`, `autoSlideMethod`, `parallaxBackgroundHorizontal`, `parallaxBackgroundVertical` and `display` configuration parameters are now supported ({uri-issue}212[#212], {uri-issue}239[#239], {uri-issue}208[#208], {uri-issue}242[#242])
  * Asciidoctor 2.0 ready ({uri-issue}245[#245])

Bug Fixes::
  * Reveal.js' `stretch` class now works with listing blocks ({uri-issue}195[#195], {uri-issue}223[#223])
  * Auto-generated slide IDs with unallowed characters (for revealjs history) now work properly.
    Upstream reveal.js fixed a bug in 3.7.0 (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/2037[#2037]) and we removed our broken workaround.
    ({uri-issue}192[#192], {uri-issue}232[#232])

Infrastructure::
  * Travis testing prepared for upcoming Asciidoctor 2.0 ({uri-issue}216[#216])
  * Travis testing for Ruby 2.6 ({uri-issue}243[#243])
