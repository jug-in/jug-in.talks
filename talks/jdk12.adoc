== 189: Shenandoah: A Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector (Experimental)
Add a new garbage collection (GC) algorithm named Shenandoah which reduces GC pause times by doing evacuation work concurrently with the running Java threads. Pause times with Shenandoah are independent of heap size, meaning you will have the same consistent pause times whether your heap is 200 MB or 200 GB.

=== Notes
* Created by Red Hat
* Minimizes 'Stop-The-World' pauses
* Handle terabytes of heap
* Nearly full concurrent execution
* Not contained in Oracle builds (but in others like AdaptOpenJDK)

=== Functioning
* Concurrent Marking
* Concurrent Cleanup
* Concurrent Evacuation
* Concurrent Update References

=== Concurrent Marking
* Init Mark: Stop the World to identify the Root-Set

* Traverse Root set, perform Tri-Color-Algorithm:
** 'Black': Alive, references scanned
** 'Grey': Alive, references not scanned yet
** 'White': Unreachable or not alive => Garbage

* Intercept Reference creation/deletion
** Mark as 'Grey'

=== Concurrent Evacuation
* Clear garbage only regions
* Evacuate Regions with few living objects
* Forward/Brooks pointer

=== Conclusion
* ParallelGC:
** Handle STW pauses
* Shenandoah:
** Scale Hardware

== 230: Microbenchmark Suite
Add a basic suite of microbenchmarks to the JDK source code, and make it easy for developers to run existing microbenchmarks and create new ones.

== 325: Switch Expressions (Preview)
Extend the switch statement so that it can be used as either a statement or an expression, and that both forms can use either a "traditional" or "simplified" scoping and control flow behavior. These changes will simplify everyday coding, and also prepare the way for the use of pattern matching (JEP 305) in switch. This will be a preview language feature.

=== Syntax (Inline)
Switch expressions are able to return values
[.code][source,java]
----
    var result = switch(value) {
        case VALID -> "It's ok dude";
        case INVALID, UNKOWN -> "Better think about it";
    };
----

=== Syntax (Blocks)
[.code][source,java]
----
var result = switch(integer) {
    case 0,1 -> integer + " is a bit to low.";
    case 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19 -> integer + " is really prime!";
    case 4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,20 -> integer + " isn't prime!";
    default -> {
        if (IntStream.range(21, integer).anyMatch(nut -> integer % nut == 0)) {
            break integer + " isn't that nice, pardon.";
        } else {
            break integer + " is a really high prime";
        }
    }
};
----

=== Type inference

[.code][source,java]
----
Number result = switch(integer) {
    case 2,3 -> integer *2;
    case 4,5 -> BigDecimal.valueOf(integer);
    case 6,7 -> integer / 2d;
    default -> (long) integer;
};
----

[.code][source,java]
----
Serializable result = switch(integer) {
    case 0,1 -> "A bit";
    case 2,3 -> integer *2;
    case 4,5 -> BigDecimal.valueOf(integer);
    default -> (long) integer;
};
----

[.code][source,java]
----
ConstantDesc result = switch(integer) {
    case 0,1 -> "A bit";
    case 2,3 -> integer *2;
    default -> (long) integer;
};

== 334: JVM Constants API
Introduce an API to model nominal descriptions of key class-file and run-time artifacts, in particular constants that are loadable from the constant pool.

`java.lang.constant`

[.type]
=== java.lang.constant.Constable
_Represents a type which is constable. A constable type is one whose values are constants that can be represented in the constant pool of a Java classfile as described in JVMS 4.4, and whose instances can describe themselves nominally as a ConstantDesc._

`public interface Constable`

Some constable types have a native representation in the constant pool:

String, Integer, Long, Double

[.type]
=== java.lang.constant.ConstantDesc
_Represents a type which is constable. A constable type is one whose values are constants that can be represented in the constant pool of a Java classfile as described in JVMS 4.4, and whose instances can describe themselves nominally as a ConstantDesc._

`public interface Constable`


== 340: One AArch64 Port, Not Two
Remove all of the sources related to the arm64 port while retaining the 32-bit ARM port and the 64-bit aarch64 port.

== 341: Default CDS Archives
Enhance the JDK build process to generate a class data-sharing (CDS) archive, using the default class list, on 64-bit platforms.

== 344: Abortable Mixed Collections for G1
Make G1 mixed collections abortable if they might exceed the pause target.

== 346: Promptly Return Unused Committed Memory from G1
Enhance the G1 garbage collector to automatically return Java heap memory to the operating system when idle.
